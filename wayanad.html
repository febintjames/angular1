                            <p class="card-text ">Wayanad is home to India’s largest earthen dam, the Banasura Sagar. The dam, which was constructed in 1979, is built across the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabani River. It is named after the Asura king Banasura, son of Mahabali, who is said to have observed a severe penance in the surrounding hills. The dam is made entirely of massive stacks of rocks and stones, and has become a popular tourist spot, known for its spectacular views and boating trips.</p>

                                Located at about 1200 ft above the sea level, the Edakkal Caves are among the oldest human settlements ever discovered. Inside the caves are pictorial drawings and engravings that indicate the presence of ancient human settlements in the region.
                                
                                Despite their name, the Edakkal Caves are not actually caves. They are part of a pre historic rock shelter, formed naturally when one huge boulder got wedged between two bigger ones. The name Edakkal itself means “a stone in between”.
                                
                                The Edakkal cave paintings are remarkable in their sheer scale and complexity, but their origins are shrouded in mystery. Ever since their discovery in 1895, they have been a source of awe and wonder for tourists and historians alike.
