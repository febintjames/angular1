                            <p class="card-text ">Nilambur, most popularly known as the land of teak plantations, is a famous town in Malappuram district. The place is noted for its vast expanse of forest along with its varied wildlife habitats, rivers and waterfalls. It is situated close to the Nilgiri range of the Western Ghats on the banks of the Chaliyar River. Considered to be the oldest in the world, the teak plantation here obtained its name after H.V. Conolly, the Malabar district collector during the British rule. He was instrumental in planting teak in the entire Nilambur area. Chathu Menon, a forest officer under Conolly, organised the hectic task of planting the saplings. Chathu Menon was laid to rest in the teak garden in Conolly's Plot.
                                
                                The teak plantation in Nilambur is situated about four kilometres from the town, on the Nilambur - Gudallur road. A well-equipped teak museum is another attraction of Nilambur. This museum is a sub-centre of the Kerala Forest Research Institute. Arranged in the two-storeyed building are exhibits, articles and details of historic, aesthetic and scientific value, which give information on all aspects of the teak to visitors.
